### WHY DO WE LEAVE?
#### Brain Drain and Burnout Analysis

##### Maybe, understand the Problem:
<li>Brain Drain: The loss of talented individuals to other regions, countries or even "for their own company".
<li>Burnout: A state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive stress.

##### Data Collection:
<li>Employee satisfaction, workload, and perceived stress levels.
<li>Exit Interviews: Understand the reasons for departures and identify potential factors contributing to brain drain (teamwork competency levels).
<li>Performance Metrics: Analyze employee productivity, absenteeism, and turnover rates.

##### Data Analysis:
<li>Statistical Analysis: Python libraries- NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy to analyze numerical data.
<li>Correlation Analysis: Determine relationships between variables (workload and burnout).
<li>Regression Analysis: Predict burnout levels based on factors (job satisfaction and work-life balance)

#### Additional Considerations:

<li>Text Analysis: Use of libraries like NLTK & spaCy to analyze textual data from surveys & exit interviews for themes related to burnout or brain drain.
<li>Machine Learning: Explore machine learning algorithms to predict burnout risk & identify factors contributing to brain drain.
<li>Visualization: Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, histograms) to communicate findings effectively.

Combine data collection, analysis, and visualization, to gain valuable insights into brain drain and burnout within the organization and implement strategies to address these issues.
